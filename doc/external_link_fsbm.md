## External Link to download Bilinear model v1.6

Considering many researchers only require the bilinear model for running the demo or other purpose, we provide the external download link for bilinear model v1.6: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nI5rI2lxSdJ4jv3o3026GWmZcbtf6OSc?usp=sharing) or [NJU Drive](https://box.nju.edu.cn/d/8845399d28bd44f0842e/).

By downloading or using the data from these links, you have to agree to the [agreement](https://facescape.nju.edu.cn/static/License_Agreement.pdf) and obey the rules, including no-commercial-use and no-distribution.

The links below only provide bilinear model v1.6, which can also be downloaded from https://facescape.nju.edu.cn/  using the license key, and they are all the same.  The previous versions and other data still need to be downloaded from https://facescape.nju.edu.cn/ after requesting the license key.  The description of the FaceScape Bilinear model can be found [here](https://github.com/zhuhao-nju/facescape_debug/blob/master/doc/doc_bilinear_model.md).
